 <h2> CSGO: The Rise and Fall [PART 2]</h2>
 <p> October 2, 2021 by Cameron Meeks </p>

 <p> With the rise of skins, CSGO gained rapid popularity and quickly became the most played game globally. With this rapid growth due to items with real world value, came gambling. CSGO gambling was huge. It was all over the front pages of sites like YouTube. Millions of views on videos of people getting rare items or spending way too much to gain nothing in the end. </p>
 <p> I took an interest to this. I bought a few keys to open a few cases, to which I had surprising luck, which only made me want to do more. I however thought it would be better to try my luck on a CSGO gambling site. So I went around a few sites to which I had no luck. I eventually stumbled unto a website that I can no longer remember the name of, but it was a roullette website where you'd bet on the colour the wheel lands on.</p>
 <p> However, I had no money. Thankfully, the site allowed its players at the time one free dollar to try their luck. I, over weeks of careful betting managed to turn the one dollar into 50 dollars. I then bought an item with equivalent value, then went to a site called 'CSGObubble', another gambling site where you coin flip items of equal value with a 50/50 chance with other players. I was very lucky on this site. I went from 50 dollars to 330 dollars in just two days. I was ecstatic! But I couldn't stop there, I wanted to keep winning. What if I doubled what I already had? I thought. Unfortunately these thoughts led me to lose every single dollar in the same night. Devastating. But a good life lesson. I'm now forever wary of gambling and have better self-control, so even though I lost the money, I gained something more valuable.

 <h2> CSGO: The Beginning [PART 1]</h2>

 <p> When I was younger, I played a game called 'Counter Strike : Global Offensive" or 'CSGO' for short. It's an FPS team based strategy game centered around Terrorists versus Counter Terrorists. The gameplay was fun, but there was another aspect that brought players to the game.</p>
 <p> CSGO became known for its 'skins', different colour schemes/patterns for weapons available to you if you owned that specific 'skin'. To get these skins, you'd have to buy a skin case and a skin key, then open the case and receive a random skin based on the crate you opened, or, buy them from other players that did this.</p>
